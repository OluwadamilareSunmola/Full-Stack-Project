# Black & Hispanic Tech Summit — Full Stack Applied

Welcome to my project from the Black & Hispanic Tech Summit! I'm excited to share with you how I connected a front-end React application to a backend REST API during this hackathon. Specifically, I configured the React Movie Picker application to use the Movie Picker API as its data source.

## Requirements

This project builds upon what I learned in the React 101 and API 101 courses. To start, I had these apps ready:

1. **Movie-picker React app** - The front-end application.
2. **Lab-3-Movies-Service Express API** - The back-end service.

You can either use the apps you've made in these courses or pull the completed versions from GitHub.

## Environment Requirements

I made sure that my machine had Node version >= 16.0.0 and npm version >= 8.5 installed. You can install Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Course Materials

In the repository, you'll find my completed fullstack-movie-picker application. This is the final React app with all updates from the hackathon.

Also, there are step-by-step instructions I followed, which you can use to replicate this project.

## Resources Used

For the Full-Stack integration, I used:

- Fetch
- Promises
- useEffect

This project was bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Getting Started

Here’s how I got started:

1. I ran the development server using `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev`.
2. Then, I opened [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

I edited the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To understand more about Next.js, I looked at the Next.js Documentation and their interactive tutorial. Their GitHub repository is also a great resource.

## Deploying on Vercel

I found that deploying the Next.js app on the Vercel Platform was the easiest method.
