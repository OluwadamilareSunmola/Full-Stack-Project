## Instructions

Hereâ€™s what I did during the hackathon:

### Initial Setup

- **Step 1: Fetching the Movie Catalog**
  - I created a data state variable and a useEffect hook.
  - Made a fetch call to our API and updated the state with response data.

- **Step 2: Pick a Movie**
  - Created a new data state variable.
  - Used useEffect hook to fetch data.

- **Step 3: Add a Movie**
  - Constructed the Request Body.
  - Made a POST request and navigated to the main page.

I ensured both the front-end and back-end applications were running on my machine. It's crucial for configuring the Full-Stack application. The React app ran on http://localhost:3000, while the API ran on http://localhost:8080.

For each step, I updated the respective components with fetch requests to interact with the API, and then ensured the data was correctly displayed or updated on the front-end.

In the end, I successfully integrated the front-end React application with the back-end Movie Service API, replacing the in-memory data source with live API data. It was a rewarding experience at the hackathon, and I learned a lot about full-stack development!

This revised version presents the project as a personal endeavor from a hackathon, focusing on the steps I took to complete it.
